# Demo Angular Material ngx-datatable responsive layout
Demo Angular ngx-datatable responsive layout.

This demo uses Angular 9 with Angular Material and the ngx-datatable.

See demo in stackblitz: https://stackblitz.com/github/baswanders/ngx-datatable-responsive-demo/tree/master/ngx-datatable-responsive-demo

For a specific project we had the following requirements to display a list/table:
- handle large datasets
- handle virtual scrolling (automatic paging)
- display the rows compact
- light component
- low dependency

This project is using Angular Material, so it should look congruent with the Material style, without much hacks.

## Full-height app
The project uses full application height/width with flex-box.
